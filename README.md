# Ideology-Search

A domain-specific “Ideologies” search engine featuring a high-performance Python-based asyncio/aiohttp crawler that gathered & deduplicated 100K+ English pages, extracted metadata & hyperlink graphs for an inverted TF-IDF, PageRank & HITS index. This project develops the full crawling → indexing → UI pipeline and benchmarks its semantic precision & contextual relevance against Google & Bing.

## Features

- **Asyncio/Aiohttp Crawler:** High-performance web crawler for large-scale data collection.
- **Deduplication:** Cleans and deduplicates crawled data.
- **Metadata & Hyperlink Extraction:** Builds metadata and hyperlink graphs for downstream indexing.
- **Indexing:** Inverted index using TF-IDF, PageRank, and HITS algorithms (scikit-learn based).
- **Full-stack Pipeline:** Seamless integration from crawling to search UI.
- **Semantic Benchmarking:** Compare and benchmark results against Google and Bing for precision and relevance.

## Backend Setup

The backend is a Python (Flask) app with async crawling and indexing.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip`

### Installation

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Requirements include:**
   - flask
   - flask-cors
   - scikit-learn
   - requests
   - beautifulsoup4
   - googlesearch-python
   - serpapi

### Running the Backend Server

```sh
python app.py
```

The backend will start (by default) at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is built using React.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Frontend

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the frontend (typically at `http://localhost:3000`) and proxy API requests to the backend.

---

## Usage

1. **Start the backend server** (see above).
2. **Start the frontend UI** (see above).
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to use the Ideology search engine.
